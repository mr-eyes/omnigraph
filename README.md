# Omnigraph

Omnigraph is a software tool that parses the well-known curated orthologous databases to construct a universal transcriptome graph. This graph facilitates the partitioning of non-model organisms reads in the best gene group, this could achieve an impactful enhancement to the de novo assembler, minimizing the time and increasing the accuracy of the final assembled transcripts.
